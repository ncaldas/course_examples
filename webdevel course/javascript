pip install South
	-> allows for the migration of attributes in models
	-before if the model was:
		﻿
class Movie(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    -> with migration you can change the attribute name "title" to something like "title_of_movie"
    
﻿
class Movie(models.Model):
    title_of_movie = models.CharField(max_length=100)

on the terminal :

pip install South

then:
python manage.py syncdb ==> need to sync hte machine again

python manage.py migrate movies

-although South is a possibility to change attributes within models, however, what happens behind is that it deletes the data and moves it to the newly named field; this can be dangerous if data is not stored properly or migrated properly therefore it is better not to use this application at all

ECMAScript 7 8
-javascript is an implementation of ecmascript using javas
-ecma ignores all the capabilities of browsers, and only defines it
-when java is used, the browser understands characteristics that ecma does not consider, to resolve this problem frameworks have been created => most famous is jQuery


-browsers
-DOM (document object model)
[tree]
root
    head
        title
            "title"
    body
        div
            div
                p
                    "text"
-the root is the selector, use in css to apply stylesheet
-jQuery adds comportamientos to things using the selector as a way to do it
-all the connections that do not need the use of a server, is allowed because of javascript => things like when going on a word it brings a message, takes you to another page, changes colour, etc

ex. jQuery("div div p").click(fn);
 each line needs to end with ; 
 the if blocks do not indent ; for javascript
 if(){
}
 else{
 }


def fn():

function fn() {
    alert();
}


------
using the console on the browser to see what javascript does
control shift j

javascript cdn should be copy and pasted within body but at the bottom
    jquery.com

when using jquery within code, you have to put in jQuery, however it is better and more compact to pass a variable (most seen is $) to become jQuery 

define an anonymous function in which the paramter is $, within the code you can use $; at the same time that is is defined it is invoked with the parameter jQuery
(function ($) {
    $("div div p").click(fn);
})(jQuery);

javascript is used in the alerts and other things that you want to do within a website, without having to reload the entire html page
for example the notifications in facebook would use Ajax
JSON => uses dictionaries and keyes that are actually strings
